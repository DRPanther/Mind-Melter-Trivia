Release name: Mind Melter Trivia

Intallation Guide :

Prerequisites:
  Must be running Mystic, which make sense, as the program is an MPL. :)


Installation:
  Create the directory 'rcs' in your Mystic Sciripts directory (/mystic/scripts/rcs)
  Then create a sub-directory within that directory called 'trivdoor' (/mystic/scripts/rcs/trivdoor)

    This directory will contain all the data, ansi, etc, files.

  Copy all files except rcs_triv.mps and rcs-triv_get.mpy into this directory

  *** VERY IMPORTANT STEP - DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP ***

  Open rcs_triv.mps in a text editor and change lines 5 - 7
  Line 5: bbs = 'Castle Rock BBS'  <=- This should be your BBS name
  Line 6: MBaseID = '16'  <=- This needs to be the message base to use for InterBBS Data
  Line 7: rcspath = '/path/to/your/mystic/scripts/rcs/trivdoor/'

  Then, save the file.

  Open rcs-triv_get.mpy file in your text editor and change line 9 and 15
  Line 9: base_id="16"  <=- This should be the same as line 6 in rcs_triv.mps
  Line 15: outdir="/path/to/your/mystic/scripts/rcs/trivdoor/"

  Then you can save this file

  Copy the rcs_triv.mps and rcs-triv_get.mpy file into your Scripts directory

  Compile the MPS file:

    Windows:
      cd \mystic\scripts\
      mplc rcs_triv

    Linux:
      cd /mystic/scripts/
